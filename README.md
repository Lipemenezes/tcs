*Project of Web Development discipline at SENAC Florian√≥polis (2017/2).<br/>
*This project was architectured to run on Tomcat 8.5 and MySQL and uses Hibernate and Web Services REST.

#### Running step by step (don't forget to clone the project and get the dependencies).
*First of all, you wanna set your database info to persistence.xml and hibernate.cfg.xml. <br/>
*Then you will create a database with the same name as the one you set on the files above. <br/>
*Now you will run the TableGenerator (this will create the database structure).

Once the tests are all running without errors, your environment is ready to go.
